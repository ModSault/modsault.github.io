## ModSault's Work

Hello. I'm a Star Fox Assault Modder who is interested in documenting my work in a nice, easy to consume way. I have to juggle this on top of my life, so please be patient.
So far I've only documented the Weapon ID's and their damage values within the game. You can check it out here: https://modsault.github.io/
